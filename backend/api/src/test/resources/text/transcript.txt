This Korean brace tofu is one of my favorite tofu dishes because it's super easy to make
plus it's back full of flavor. It's also very spicy. I love spice but if you don't like it too
spicy, you can also add less chili powder and it's great with rice for a really hardy and complete meal
and I really love to prepare this in advance because I usually do meal prep at a serve
a week and I like to make this in a big batch and store it in the fridge in a container and
a 3-heat whatever I want to enjoy. So to start we have some extra firm tofu. The best is to use
extra firm or firm tofu with a recipe and I like to wash off any slimeiness from the tofu
because it's usually even sitting in the same packaging and the same liquid for a few days.
I wrap my tofu in some paper towels. You can also use a kitchen or dish towel if you like
and just leave that to press. I like to use some bananas in a basket for weight. You also use a few
pants or a few boards. Once it's pressed and excess water has drawn out, you can go ahead and slice
this however way you like. I actually did not think this through and I just cut it initially into
eight until it realized they were a bit too thick. I sliced them in half until they were around like
three-four of an inch thick. I prepared a basting liquid or a sauce, started with some water,
along with some rice vinegar, soy sauce, mirin, sugar and of course some gochugar or chili powder,
sesame oil, garlic and some cut-up scallions or green onions or spring onions. I like to add
the white parts into the sauce. The full recipe is also linked down below if you want to check that out.
I hid a walk with some mutual oil. I used vegetable oil added the tofu slices in and left it
to cook until the sides were golden brown. Flip it over to cook the other side. I got a paper towel
to soak up any of the excess oil and I actually cooked the tofu batches, earthen the other first batch
into the pan and I added in a basting liquid or sauce and released a simmer for a few minutes.
I left mine covered and afterwards I opened that allow the sauce to reduce and once it's
reduced you can go ahead and mix it up and add green parts of the green onion and that's pretty
much you finish based tofu. Get enjoyed immediately or prepare it for your upcoming meals.
Thank you so much for watching and I will see you in my next video.
