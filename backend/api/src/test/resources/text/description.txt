Spicy egg fried rice ðŸ”¥ Recipe ðŸ‘‡

INGREDIENTS:
5-6 green onions
6 cloves of garlic
1-2 tbsp crushed chilli flakes (add based on spice tolerance)
2 servings cold rice
2 eggs
Cooking oil as needed
â€”Sauceâ€”
1 tbsp light/regular soy sauce
1 tbsp dark soy sauce
1 tbsp water
1 tsp sugar
Note: Add salt if needed

PROCESS:
1. Clean and trim 5-6 green onions. Mince the white parts and thinly slice the green parts for garnish
2. Mince 6 cloves of garlic. Add more or less depending on size of the cloves or taste
3. Take 2 servings of cold, day old rice in a bowl and separate the clumps. This helps in even stir frying. Cold, slightly dried out rice is essential for the perfect fried rice texture
4. Mix the sauce ingredients in a bowl and set aside
5. To a heated wok/pan add some oil and scramble 2 eggs with a pinch of salt. Set aside
6. Set flame to medium and add 2 tbsp neutral cooking oil. When the oil is hot, sautÃ© the garlic and green onion for 30 seconds
7. Reduce flame to low and sautÃ© 1-2 tbsp crushed red chilli flakes for 30 seconds or until fragrant. Chilli flakes will burn if the flame is too high
8. Increase flame to medium high, add rice and stir fry until mixed well with the aromatics
9. Add the prepared sauce and stir fry for 2-3 minutes. The rice needs to fry well so keep tossing and turning
10. When the rice is fried well, add the previously scrambled eggs. Mix everything well and adjust salt if needed
11. Add the green part of green onions and switch off the flame. You donâ€™t want to overcook them
12. Serve the spicy egg fried rice with a crispy fried egg, a side of your choice or on its own
