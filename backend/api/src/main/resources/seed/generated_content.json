It is also quite spicy, so if you don't like it too hot, you can reduce the amount of chili powder. It is great served with rice, making it a hearty and complete meal. I often prepare it in advance as part of my weekly meal prepping."

Wrap the tofu in paper towels or a kitchen or dish towel and leave it to press. Use a few cans or boards to add weight. Once the excess water has been drawn out, slice the tofu into 3/4 inch thick pieces."
